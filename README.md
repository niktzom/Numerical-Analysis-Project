# Numerical-Analysis-Project
Assignment for the Numerical Analysis course @ECE AUTH.

Semester Assignment consisting of two tasks:

### (a) 

Create Python functions implementing the following numerical integration rules(composite forms):

 * Left rectangle(left Riemann sum)
 * Right rectangle(right Riemann sum)
 * Trapezoid rule
 * Simpson's rule
 
 Then create a log-log diagram in which for various step-size(h) values we see the absolute error of each method.
 
 
### (b)

Create a Python function that implements the Euler's method to numerically solve a system of differential equations.

 Using the function we solve a system of Lotka-Volterra equations about the population of rabbits and foxes in a forest. 
 
 Then we generate 2 diagrams one for the popoulation growth against time and for the one population against the other(phase space).
 
 The final commit was made using Jupyter Notebook.
